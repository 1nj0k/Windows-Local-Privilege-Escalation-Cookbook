## Vulnerabilities

This cheatsheet presents the following Windows vulnerabilities:

- [AlwaysInstallElevated](#alwaysinstallelevated)

### AlwaysInstallElevated

#### Description

The "AlwaysInstallElevated" is a Windows vulnerability that stems from a misconfiguration in the Windows Installer service. This vulnerability occurs when the "AlwaysInstallElevated" registry key is set to "1" in the Windows Registry.

When this registry key is enabled, it allows non-administrator users to install software packages with elevated privileges. In other words, users who shouldn't have administrative rights can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code with elevated permissions, potentially compromising the security of the system.

#### Lab Setup
