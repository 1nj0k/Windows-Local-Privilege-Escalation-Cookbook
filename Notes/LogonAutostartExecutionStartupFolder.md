## Description

Logon Autostart Execution via Startup Folder is a Windows feature that enables specific programs or scripts to launch automatically when a user logs into the system. This feature allows these programs or scripts to launch automatically without any manual action from the user when the operating system starts up.

Attackers may exploit the Logon Autostart Execution feature by inserting malicious software into the Startup Folder. This enables the malicious code to automatically launch during system startup, potentially granting it elevated privileges.
